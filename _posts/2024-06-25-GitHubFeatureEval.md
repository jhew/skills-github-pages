title: "GitHub Feature Eval"

In the sprawling digital expanse of GitHub,
new features emerge, quietly announcing themselves
among the already dense landscape of tools.
We sift through, methodically,
evaluatingâ€”
does this integrate?
does it disrupt?
In this silent labor,
no grand applause awaits,
just the steady hum of progress,
sometimes noticed,
often just absorbed into the fabric
of our daily coding rituals.
